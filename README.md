##Complete List of SRFP Guides (Sortable & Searchable)

The official list is available [here](http://web-japps.ias.ac.in:8080/fellowship2013/selectfellows.jsp?atype=B&area=%25). I felt a need for sorting by interest, specialization etc., and better search hence built this.

IAS still holds all rights to make changes, hence that should be consulted as the official list.
