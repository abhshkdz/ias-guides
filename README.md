###[Complete List of Guides](http://abhshkdz.github.com/ias-guides/)

The official list is available [here](http://web-japps.ias.ac.in:8080/fellowship2013/selectfellows.jsp?atype=B&area=%25). I felt a need for sorting by interest, specialization etc., and better search hence built this.

IAS obviously holds all rights to update their list whenever. So that should be consulted as the official list.
